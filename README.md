# Coding Quiz

## Description

* The repository shows an application where a user takes a coding quiz to assess their coding knowlege.  The quiz includes a built in timer and includes multiple choice questions that are asked of the user.  This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.  It has a responsive user interface to be laid out properly on various size screens.

* To start the quiz, the user clicks on the "start" button.  Then a a timer starts and the user is presented with a question.  Upon answering the question, the user is presented with another question.  If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.  When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over.  The user saves their initials and score.

* The HTML code contains a logical structure for the elements within the page.  There are sections within the body showing how the first page looks.  Upon starting the quiz a timer is started and the first page of questions is shown, as listed in the HTML body, with code for following pages thereafter.  After the pages with various questions are answered, a page with the title, "All Done" is shown.  Once the user enters their initials and selects the "submit" button, a page is shown for the "Highscores".  

* There is a linked CSS style file that lays out the style for the password generator.

* There is a linked Javascipt file, called: script.js.  This JavaScript file contains the code that allows for the generating of the unique password, based on user prompts. 

* Notes were applied to the HTML code, CSS and JavaScript code to identify each section of code. 

<!-- * When the password generator button is selected a series of alerts and prompts open to define what the password will contain.  The initial alert asks the user how many characters they would like the password to contain.  After the alert are a series of prompts.  The first prompt asks the user to confirm if they want the password to include special characters.  The next prompt asks the user if they want the password to include numeric characters.  The next prompt asks the user if they want the password to include lowercase characters.  The final prompt ask the user if they want the password to include uppercase characters.  After all prompts are selected a password is generated based on criteria the user entered. -->
